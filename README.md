Testing if a Distribution is Normal
### Boxplot-Whisker Plot, Histogram and QQ-Plot
We can visually check if a distribution looks normally distributed. 
1. A box whisker plot lets us check for symmetry around the mean. 
2. A histogram lets us see the overall shape. 
3. A QQ-plot lets us compare our data distribution with a normal distribution (or any other theoretical "ideal" distribution).
### Testing for Normality
#### Shapiro-Wilk
#### Kolmogorov-Smirnov
